**Acknowledgment**
===================

We the summer interns team of Multimedia Transcoder are over helmed in all humbleness
and gratefulness to acknowledge our depth to all those who have helped us to put our ideas
and assigned work, well above the level of simplicity and into something concrete.

We all thank whole heartedly Prof. Deepak Phatak for selecting us a part of his valuable
project, constantly motivating for doing better and showing complete confidence in our work.

We are indebted to our Project Manager Mr. Parag Tiwari for his constant help and support in
light of this project.We are very thankful to our mentor Mr.Vivek Nadar for his valuable
suggestions, guidance and encouragement. Also in the process, we learnt a lot other technical
and non technical things from them

We would like to thank Mr.Bikas Chhatri for making our stay here as summer
interns comfortable and for all his administrative help.

Finally we also like to thank all other colleagues working in different projects under Prof.
Phatak for helping us at small problems as well as critical junctures.

**Abstract**
=============

Nowadays video is being produced and consumed in more component
representation formats, more device types and over variety of networks than ever.
Transcoding is a process of translating or converting one coded signal representation to
another. However most of the time transcoding becomes computationally intensive process
and complex task if done through command line/terminal. Due to this, one might need a
graphical user interface which is easy to use by anyone .This “Multimedia Transcoder”
project aims at providing a user-friendly GUI to easily and quickly convert videos/audios
from one format to another , specify different codecs,resolutions,aspect ratios,frame rates ,bit
rates.

**INTRODUCTION**
=================

Rich media resources transmitted over wired and wireless networks are becoming more and more important for our life. Users of devices, such as computers, PDAs, mobile phones, require accessing the Internet and networks from anywhere and at any time regardless of resources, network conditions, and capabilities of client devices. Intelligent media conversions, such as scalability, transcoding and modality changes, are the important means for multimedia adaptation and Universal Multimedia Access (UMA) .

Real-time transcoding in a many-to-many way (any input format to any output format) is becoming a necessity to provide true search capability for any multimedia content on any mobile device, with over 500 million videos on the web and a plethora of mobile devices.


============
**PURPOSE**
============

Transcoding is defined, in general, as the conversion of one compressed signal to another.Transcoding is the direct digital-to-digital data conversion of one encoding to another, such as for movie data files or audio files. This is usually done in cases where a target device (or workflow) does not support the format or has limited storage capacity that mandates a reduced file size,or to convert incompatible or obsolete data to a better-supported or modern format. The research workconcerning transcoding is mainly focused on efficiency,complexity, latency, processing power, error resilience, bit rate change, resolution change, frame rate change, picture quality and so forth. To solve the problems, the coding methods, algorithms and international coding standards used for design and implementation of transcoding architectures are critical.

Due to the expansion and diversity of multimedia applications ,present
communication infrastructure comprised of different underlying networks and protocols and
new and new PDA’s being launched everyday into the market like the recently developed
Aakash Tablet ,there has been a growing need for a single video being available in different
formats and codecs supported by different platforms. New software codecs are used in
difffernt consumer products to make them cheaper and more effective ,eg the latest being
H264.For this there is a need of software that would quickly ,easily and efficiently convert a
previously compressed video signal into another one with different format,such as different
bit rate, frame rate, frame size, or even compression standard. An already available software
for this purpose is FFmpeg. It is a complete, cross-platform solution to play, convert and
stream audio and video. It has the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode,
transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge,no
matter if they were designed by some standards committee, the community or a corporation.
But it is too difficult to be used by a common-user. It has to be executed using command-line
/terminal which is not very convenient for everyone . “AV Transcoder” is an easy yet a
professional solution for this. It is basically a simple and comfortable interface to FFmpeg .It does all the work using FFmpeg in backend. User doesn’t need to remember the complex
commands . Everything can be done with click.

The main purpose of most video converter program is to convert media already on your
computer to a more compatible format on other computers or digital devices. Video converter
software is particularly useful when you own an digital device eg Aakash, but have a video
with settings that cant be played on that. A conundrum many are running into is they are
uploading and editing their home videos on their home computer, but they can’t transfer and
play them on their mobile or tablet. This is where AV Transcoder comes into picture.

==========
**SCOPE**
==========

“AV Transcoder” is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7 and Ubuntu 11.10
and above.” For Ubuntu the FFmpeg version currently being used is FFmpeg 0.7.13 “peace”.
For windows FFmpeg version used is FFmpeg-git-c-103dc0 32-bit Static. It can be upgraded
further with newer versions. New Formats and Codecs can also be added in future
